Welcome to the Miscellaneous Image Processing Toolkit! This repository contains a collection of miscellaneous methods and experiments related to image processing. Please note that this is a side project and not actively maintained. The purpose of this toolkit is to experiment with various image processing techniques and share insights with the community. Feel free to explore the provided Jupyter Notebook (`test.ipynb`) to see the implemented methods.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`test.ipynb`) that showcases the following image processing techniques:

1. **Convolution Function**: A method for applying convolution to an image using a given kernel.

2. **Image Loading**: A method to load images from a specified directory and convert them into NumPy arrays.

3. **Sobel Edge Detection**: Implementation of the Sobel edge detection algorithm along with non-maximal suppression (NMS) for enhancing detected edges.

4. **Canny Edge Detection**: Utilizing the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify edges in an image.

5. **Morphological Operations**: Applying morphological closing and image filling to enhance edge detection results.

6. **Cluster Labeling**: Labeling connected components in a binary image and removing small clusters.

7. **Background Removal**: Demonstrating how the pipeline can be used to remove backgrounds from product images.

8. **Cropping and Resizing**: Identifying non-white regions and cropping/resizing the image accordingly.

9. **Color Adjustment**: Attempting to adjust colors based on a specified threshold.

10. **Saving Results**: Saving the processed images to disk.

## Usage

To use the provided methods and experiments, simply open the Jupyter Notebook `test.ipynb`. Execute each cell to see the results of different image processing techniques.

Please note that this project is not actively maintained, and some code segments might be incomplete or experimental. Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the methods for your own use.
