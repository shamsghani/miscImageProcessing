## miscImageProcessing

Welcome to **miscImageProcessing** - a collection of image-processing algorithms that are hanging out here, sipping virtual coffee, and occasionally doing a bit of pixel tinkering. This repository is like that cozy corner of your virtual world where code gathers dust, but fear not, it's not abandoned – just marinating slowly, like a fine algorithmic stew.

**Disclaimer:** This is not your everyday, run-of-the-mill, hyperactive open-source project. No, no. We like to take it easy here. The functions here reside in a file charmingly named `test.ipynb`, because, well, we believe in giving algorithms a comfy home to relax and ponder about their pixelated existence.

### Functions

Here's an overview of some of the functions available in this codebase:

#### Load Images

Load images from a directory to begin your image-processing journey.

#### Sobel Filter and Non-Maximal Suppression

Apply the Sobel filter and subsequent non-maximal suppression for edge detection.

#### Color Representation of Gradient

Visualize gradients by representing them using color mapping.

#### Threshold Map for Highlight Enhancement and Shadow Darkening

Generate a threshold map that boosts highlights and darkens shadows, creating a binary image with enhanced contrasts.

#### Canny Edge Detection

Utilize the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify edges within images.

#### Cluster Detection and Removal

Detect clusters within an image and implement strategies to remove them as needed.

#### Recropping for White Space Removal

Recrop images to eliminate excessive white spaces and improve composition.

#### Image Cutout Using Masks

Create image cutouts based on specified masks to extract specific regions of interest.

#### Selective Color Brightening

Enhance the brightness of pixels exceeding a specified threshold, selectively boosting colors.

### Project Activity

Is this project active, you ask? Well, let's say it's taking a sabbatical in the world of bits and bytes. Updates happen on their own sweet time, like a turtle in a digital marathon. Feel free to fork, tinker, or even toss in your own algorithmic experiments. Just remember, patience is key – in this repository, we measure progress in leisurely coffee spoons.

### How to Join the Chill Zone

1. Clone this repository to your digital playground.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/miscImageProcessing.git
   ```

2. Slide into the cozy `test.ipynb` file – that's where the magic (code) happens.

3. Explore, experiment, and extend these functions at your own pace. Remember, no rush, we're on island time here.

### Contributions

Interested in reviving this virtual coffee club? Contributions are welcome! Here's how:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch – give it a whimsical name.

2. Shake the dust off those algorithms, add new ones, or sprinkle some debugging magic.

3. Commit your changes and push them like sending a message in a bottle across the digital seas.

4. Open a pull request – let's chat about your pixelated sorcery.

### License

This project enjoys a license that's as laid-back as its code. Feel free to explore, experiment, and enjoy the virtual ambiance. Just remember, while you're welcome to hang around and make yourself at home, commercial endeavors might need a separate invitation.

**Note:** This repository is akin to a digital secret garden. It's not bustling with activity, but it's alive and evolving in its own leisurely rhythm. So go ahead, explore, experiment, and let your algorithms stretch their virtual legs.
